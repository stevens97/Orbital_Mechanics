This Jupyter Notebook provides a tutorial of how orbital mechanics can be computed numerically within Python.

This is done by calculating the orbit of Halley's comet.
Based on Exercise 3.6 and 3.11 of Numerical methods for Physics, Garcia (2000).

This code is primarily for educational purposes.

## Prerequisites for using this program:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- math
